## Description of the Triangle Tracker program
<p> I have built a program that enables 2 players to play a game called Pig Dice. This game involves
the two players choosing to either roll the dice and get some points or hold the dice and not get any more points. When a player rolls and lands on 1, he/she loses all the points they had scored during that roll. If
they chose to hold, the points they had scored during that roll are added to their final score. The first player who scores 100 points first wins the game.</p>
