        <h1>Welcome to the pig dice game. This is a very interesting and interactive game.</h1>
          <p>Here are the game rules:
            <ul>
              <li>To start, roll a die. The goal is to accumulate as many point as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.</li>
              <li>The first player to score more than 100 point wins.</li>
              <li>If the number is 2, 3 4, 5 or 6, you score. You get to  keep your points and can roll again.</li>
              <li>As long as you don't roll number 1, you're fine. If you do, you forfeit any points accumulated during this turn.</li>
              <li>If a player chooses to 'hold', their turn total is added to the score and it  becomes the next player's turn to play.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
